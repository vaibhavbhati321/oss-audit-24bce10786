# Script 2: FOSS Package Inspector
# Author: Vaibhav | Course: Open Source Software
# Purpose: Checks whether a specified open-source package is
#          installed on the system, displays its version and
#          license info, and prints a short philosophy note
#          using a case statement.
# Concepts: if-then-else, case statement, dpkg/rpm, pipe, grep
# ==============================================================

# --- Define the package to inspect ---
# Default package is 'git'; user can override by passing an argument
PACKAGE="${1:-git}"
