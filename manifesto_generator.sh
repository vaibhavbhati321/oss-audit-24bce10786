# Script 5: Open Source Manifesto Generator
# Author: Vaibhav | Course: Open Source Software
# Purpose: Generates a personalised open-source philosophy
#          statement by asking the user three questions,
#          composing a paragraph from the answers, and saving
#          it to a timestamped .txt file.
# Concepts: read for user input, string concatenation,
#           writing to a file with > and >>, date command,
#           aliases (demonstrated via comments)
# ==============================================================

# --- Alias demonstration ---
# In bash, aliases are shortcuts for longer commands. For example:
# alias ll='ls -la'        → typing 'll' runs 'ls -la'
# alias gs='git status'    → typing 'gs' runs 'git status'
# alias update='sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y'
# Aliases are typically defined in ~/.bashrc or ~/.bash_aliases
# They are best suited for interactive shells, not scripts,
# because scripts run in a non-interactive subshell where
# aliases are not expanded by default.
